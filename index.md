The same is being adopted in this theme, which is currently working being developed by Associate Professor, Dr. [Hasan Ali Khattak](https://github.com/hasanalikhattak) at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad. This theme was conceived out of need, as during an international conference it was felt that there is no elegant theme that matches the needs and styles as defined under the [NUST branding](https://nust.edu.pk/about-us/nust-brand/).
